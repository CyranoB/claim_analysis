# Claim Verifier

This project provides a tool to analyze claims made in a webpage or document. It takes a webpage URL or a file as input and outputs an analysis of the claims found within.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to automate the process of claim verification. By analyzing the text content of a given webpage or document, the tool identifies and evaluates the claims made, providing users with a detailed analysis.

## Versions

This project has two versions of the claims verifier:

1.  **Single-Shot LLM Call:** This version uses a single call to a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the input and extract claims. It's designed for quick analysis and is suitable for simpler documents or webpages.

2.  **Agentic Workflow:** This version employs an agentic workflow, which involves multiple steps and tools to analyze the input. This approach is more robust and can handle complex documents or webpages with multiple claims. It may involve breaking down the analysis into smaller tasks, using different tools for each task, and then combining the results.

## How to Use

Detailed instructions on how to use each version of the claim verifier will be provided in the documentation.
